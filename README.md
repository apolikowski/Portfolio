## <a name="aboutme">🔎About Me</a>

I'm a software tester with almost two years of experience. From the beginning of my journey as a tester I'm associated with one of the biggest pharmaceutical warehouse in Central Europe - DOZ Direct. I'm responsible for testing frontend, backend and mobile apps used in a warehouse and Pharmacies. My daily responsibilities consist of working with team of bussiness analysts, developers and other testers, reporting defects, analyzing functional specifications and making documentation such as test scenarios and test confirmations.<br>

In 2021 I graduated with a master's degree as Dental Technician. That studies was combined between Medical University Of Lodz and Lodz University Of Technology. I never felt connected with that proffesion so in 2022 I decided to change industries and reskill myself to IT.<br>
