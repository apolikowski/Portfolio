I'm a software tester with almost two years of experience. From the beginning of my journey as a tester I'm associated with one of the biggest pharmaceutical warehouse in Central Europe - DOZ Direct. I'm responsible for testing frontend, backend and mobile apps used in a warehouse and DOZ Pharmacies. My daily responsibilities consist of working with team of bussiness analysts, developers and other testers, reporting defects, making documentation such as test scenarios and test confirmations and analyzing functional specifications.
