## <a name="aboutme">🔎About Me</a>

I'm a software tester with almost two years of experience. From the beginning of my journey as a tester I'm associated with one of the biggest pharmaceutical warehouse in Central Europe - DOZ Direct. I'm responsible for testing frontend, backend and mobile apps used in a warehouse and Pharmacies. My daily responsibilities consist of working with team of bussiness analysts, developers and other testers, reporting defects, analyzing functional specifications and making documentation such as test scenarios and test confirmations.<br>

In my current position I quickly gained trust of my supervisors as a person that can handle difficulties and solve daily problems. I was appreciated and received some of the responsibilities of my menager.
I was responsible for supervising my team defects statuses and during my menager absentcy I supervised implementations and deployments on production.<br>

In my current company I implemented a few of my ideas for optimization:
- Started makeing automated frontend regression tests as first person in the team 
- Creating some of the automations for creating a testing data used in manual testing
- Creating shared repo for screenshots used in test confirmations, when someone is absent in work someoneelse can finish documentation required for deployment.<br>

<!--- In 2021 I graduated with a master's degree as Dental Technician. That studies was combined between Medical University Of Lodz and Lodz University Of Technology. I never felt connected with that proffesion so in 2022 I decided to change industries and reskill myself to IT.<br> --->
